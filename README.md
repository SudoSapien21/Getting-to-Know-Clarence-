# Getting-to-Know-Clarence-

## Portfolio
I created a portfolio to allow potential employers to see my creativity, vulnerability, adaptability, and work ethic.

## User Story
For this website, I had to use my code from scratch. This task created repetition and challenged me to think about how HTML and CSS work.

## Authors
Code Provided by UofM Coding Bootcamp 
Modifications were done by ~Clarence Tolson~
